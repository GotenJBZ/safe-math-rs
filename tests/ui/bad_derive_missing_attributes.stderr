error[E0277]: Type `Foo` cannot perform safe addition.

   | ^^^^^^^^^^^^ the trait `SafeAdd` is not implemented for `Foo`

   = note: Add `add` to `#[SafeMathOps(...)]` when deriving `SafeMathOps`.
note: required by a bound in `safe_math::safe_add`

   = note: this error originates in the attribute macro `safe_math` which comes from the expansion of the macro `impl_safe_math_ops` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
